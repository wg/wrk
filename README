wrk - a HTTP benchmarking tool

  wrk is a modern HTTP benchmarking tool capable of generating significant
  load when run on a single multi-core CPU. It combines a multithreaded
  design with scalable event notification systems such as epoll and kqueue.

Basic Usage

  wrk -t12 -c400 -d30s http://127.0.0.1:8080/index.html

  This runs a benchmark for 30 seconds, using 12 threads, and keeping
  400 HTTP connections open.

  Output:

  Running 30s test @ http://127.0.0.1:8080/index.html
    12 threads and 400 connections

Benchmarking Tips

  The machine running wrk must have a sufficient number of ephemeral ports
  available and closed sockets should be recycled quickly. To handle the
  initial connection burst the server's listen(2) backlog should be greater
  than the number of concurrent connections being tested.

Acknowledgements

  wrk contains code from a number of open source projects including the
  'ae' event loop from redis, the nginx/joyent/node.js 'http-parser' and
  the Tiny Mersenne Twister PRNG. Please consult the NOTICE file for
