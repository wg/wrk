#wrk - a HTTP benchmarking tool
wrk is a modern HTTP benchmarking tool capable of generating significant
load when run on a single multi-core CPU. It combines a multithreaded
design with scalable event notification systems such as epoll and kqueue.

An optional LuaJIT script can perform HTTP request generation, response
processing, and custom reporting. Details are available in SCRIPTING and
several examples are located in `scripts/`

##Basic Usage
```sh
wrk -t12 -c400 -d30s http://127.0.0.1:8080/index.html
```
This runs a benchmark for 30 seconds, using 12 threads, and keeping
400 HTTP connections open.

**Output:**
```txt

  12 threads and 400 connections
  Thread Stats   Avg      Stdev     Max   +/- Stdev

    Req/Sec    56.20k     8.07k   62.00k    86.54%

Requests/sec: 748868.53
Transfer/sec:    606.33MB
```

##Benchmarking Tips
The machine running wrk must have a sufficient number of ephemeral ports
available and closed sockets should be recycled quickly. To handle the
initial connection burst the server's listen(2) backlog should be greater
than the number of concurrent connections being tested.

A user script that only changes the HTTP method, path, adds headers or
a body, will have no performance impact. Per-request actions, particularly
building a new HTTP request, and use of response() will necessarily reduce
the amount of load that can be generated.
